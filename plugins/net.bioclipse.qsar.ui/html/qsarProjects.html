<h1>QSAR Projects</h1>

<p>
Bioclipse resources are grouped in Projects in the Bioclipse Navigator; see the page 
<a href="../../PRODUCT_PLUGIN/html/concepts.html"">Bioclipse Concepts</a> for a general introduction.

<p>
A QSAR Project is required to to work with Bioclipse-QSAR in the GUI. It can be created from 
the main menu under <b>File > New</b>  menu and then selecting <b>QSAR > QSAR Project</b>. 
When created, a new project appears in the Bioclipse Navigator, and contains the central file (also called 
Project File), <b>qsar.xml</b>. This is the file that contains all information about the QSAR project, such as 
the chemical structures, chosen descriptors, responses, metadata etc. and adheres to the <a href="../qsar-ml.html">QSAR-ML</a> exchange format. 
Double-clicking the qsar.xml file opens the <a href="editor/overviewPage.html">QSAR Editor</a>.

<p>
After a QSAR project is built, it can also contain the files <b>dataset.csv</b> and <b>descriptorValues.xml</b>. 
These are derived (=generated) files which contains the calculated information from the QSAR project. 
It is not recommended to edit these files as they are overwritten on every QSAR project build.
